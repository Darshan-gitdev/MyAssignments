Q.1.count the number of files and folder present in the directory.  if possible take the directory path from user


#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user for the directory path
read -p "Enter the directory path: " directory

# Check if the directory exists
if [ ! -d "$directory" ]; then
  echo "Error: Directory '$directory' does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

# Count files and directories recursively using find and wc
file_count=$(find "$directory" -type f | wc -l)
dir_count=$(find "$directory" -type d | wc -l)

# Subtract 2 from the directory count to exclude the current directory and its parent directory
dir_count=$((dir_count - 2))

# Print the results
echo "Number of files: $file_count"
echo "Number of directories: $dir_count"
