Q. Create a function that takes a filename as an argument and 
             prints the number of lines in the file. Call this function 
             from your script with different filenames.

#!/bin/bash

# Function to count lines in a file
count_lines() {
  # Check if file exists
  if [ ! -f "$1" ]; then
    echo "Error: File '$1' does not exist."
    return 1
  fi
  
  # Use wc to count lines
  line_count=$(wc -l < "$1")
  echo "$1 has $line_count lines."
}

# Call the function with different filenames
count_lines "userinput.sh"
