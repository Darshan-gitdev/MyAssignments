Q.Write a script that reads numbers from the user until they
              enter '0'. The script should also print whether each number is odd or even.

#!/bin/bash

while true; do
  read -p "Enter a number (0 to quit): " number

  # Check if the user entered '0' to quit
  if [ "$number" == "0" ]; then
    break
  fi

  # Check if the input is a valid number
  if [[ ! "$number" =~ ^[-+]?[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    echo "Invalid input. Please enter a number."
    continue
  fi

  # Determine if the number is even or odd
  if (( number % 2 == 0 )); then
    echo "$number is even"
  else
    echo "$number is odd"
  fi
done
